# SpeechActionClassifier

This repository contains code written by me for my bachelor's thesis titled *Speaker Diarization Based on Facial Expression Analysis via Supervised Machine Learning*.

The master branch of this repository contains base code for running the application, while the branches titled "Model_TypeA" and "Model_TypeB" contain the final two working topologies for the predictor model.

The model has been trained and verified with the D3PERJ Dataset (Proprietary) as well as the publicly available [AMI Meetings Corpus](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/).

The monograph, available [here](http://www.monografias.poli.ufrj.br/monografias/monopoli10031910.pdf), is written in Portuguese.

This project was overseen by Professor [Geraldo Zimbr√£o da Silva, D.Sc.](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/pt-BR/pessoas/details/18/1021-zimbrao) of the Computer Systems Research Program (PESC) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It was produced in conjunction with a project for the Public Defenders Office to produce diarizations of legal statements.
