            This paper reintroduces the discussion about stress-timing in Brazilian Portuguese (BP). It begins by surveying some phonetic and phonological issues raised by the syllable- vs stress-timed dichotomy which culminated with the emergence of the p-center notion. Strict considerations of timing of V-V units and stress groups are taken into account to analyze the long term coupling of two basic oscillators (vowel and stress flow). This coupling allows a two-parameter characterization of language rhythms (coupling strength and speech rate) revealing that BP utterances present a high-degree of syllable-timing. A comparison with other languages, including European Portuguese, is also presented. The results analyzed indicate that Major's arguments for considering Portuguese (sic) as stress-timing are misleading.},

  abstract = {In this paper two different approaches to enhance the performance of the most challenging component of a Speaker Diarization system are presented, i.e. the speaker clustering part. A processing step is proposed enhancing the input features with a temporal smoothing process combined with nonlinear filtering. We, also, propose improvements on the Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) algorithm -- a nonlinear feature transformation. The performance of these enhancements is compared with different clustering algorithms, such as the UISRNN, k-Means, Spectral clustering and x-Means. The evaluation is held on three different tasks, i.e. the AMI, DIHARD and an internal meeting transcription task. The proposed approaches assume a known number of speakers and time segmentations for the audio files. Since, we focus only on the clustering component of diarization for this work, the segmentation provided is assumed perfect. Finally, we present how supervision, in the form of given speaker profiles, can further improve the overall diarization performance. The proposed enhancements yield substantial relative improvements in all 3 tasks, with 20\textbackslash\% in AMI and 19\textbackslash\% better than the best diarization system for DIHARD task, when the number of speakers is known.},

This framework uses speaker clustering as a way to automatically select data from unlabeled corpora to train i-vector PLDA models. Performances between supervised and unsupervised models are compared. The experimental results on two distinct test corpora (one TV, one Radio) show that unsupervised models perform as good as supervised models for both tasks. Such results indicate that performing an effective cross-show diarization on new language or new domain data in the future should not depend on the availability of manually annotated data.},

This corpus is being recorded in several instrumented rooms equipped with a variety of microphones, video cameras, electronic pens, presentation slide capture and white-board capture devices. As well as real meetings, the corpus contains a significant proportion of scenario-driven meetings, which have been designed to elicit a rich range of realistic behaviors. To facilitate research, the raw data are being annotated at a number of levels including speech transcriptions, dialogue acts and summaries. The corpus is being distributed using a web server designed to allow convenient browsing and download of multimedia content and associated annotations. This article first overviews AMI research themes, then discusses corpus design, as well as data collection, annotation and distribution.},

Although the main physical correlate of pitch is acoustic periodicity, or repetition rate, there are many interactions that complicate the relationship between the physical stimulus and the perception of pitch. In particular, the effects of other acoustic parameters on pitch judgments, and the complex interactions between perceptual organization and pitch, have uncovered interesting perceptual phenomena that should help to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we use data augmentation to improve performance of deep neural network (DNN) embeddings for speaker recognition. The DNN, which is trained to discriminate between speakers, maps variable-length utterances to fixed-dimensional embeddings that we call x-vectors. Prior studies have found that embeddings leverage large-scale training datasets better than i-vectors. However, it can be challenging to collect substantial quantities of labeled data for training. We use data augmentation, consisting of added noise and reverberation, as an inexpensive method to multiply the amount of training data and improve robustness. The x-vectors are compared with i-vector baselines on Speakers in the Wild and NIST SRE 2016 Cantonese. We find that while augmentation is beneficial in the PLDA classifier, it is not helpful in the i-vector extractor. However, the x-vector DNN effectively exploits data augmentation, due to its supervised training. As a result, the x-vectors achieve superior performance on the evaluation datasets.},
